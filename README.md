# iNat Backlog Slogger
**Work in progress!**

This is a proof-of-concept of a tool to assist iNaturalist identifiers, with the goal of making
it easier to sort through the backlog of unidentified iNaturalist observations.

Using image quality assessment and other criteria, it will attempt to find observations that are
most likely to be high-quality ones, and filter out observations that are most likely to be
unidentifiable.
