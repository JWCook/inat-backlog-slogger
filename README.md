# iNat Backlog Slogger
**Work in progress / not yet fully functional!**

This is a tool that slogs through the backlog of unidentified iNaturalist observations so you don't have to.
Using image quality assessment and other criteria, it will attempt to find observations that are most likely
to be high-quality ones and filter out observations that are most likely to be unidentifiable.

Some proof-of-concept reports are viewable at: https://inat-backlog-slogger.netlify.app
